Using first‐principles calculations, we predict highly stable cubic bialkali bismuthides
Cs(Na, K)<sub>2</sub>Bi with several technologically important mechanical and anisotropic elastic properties.
We investigate the mechanical and anisotropic elastic properties under hydrostatic tension and
compression. At zero pressure, CsK<sub>2</sub>Bi is characterized by elastic anisotropy with maximum and
minimum stiffness along the directions of [111] and [100], respectively. Unlike CsK<sub>2</sub>Bi, CsNa<sub>2</sub>Bi ex‐
hibits almost isotropic elastic behavior at zero pressure. We found that hydrostatic tension and com‐
pression change the isotropic and anisotropic mechanical responses of these compounds. Moreover,
the auxetic nature of the CsK<sub>2</sub>Bi compound is tunable under pressure. This compound transforms
into a material with a positive Poisson’s ratio under hydrostatic compression, while it holds a large
negative Poisson’s ratio of about −0.45 along the [111] direction under hydrostatic tension. An aux‐
etic nature is not observed in CsNa<sub>2</sub>Bi, and Poisson’s ratio shows completely isotropic behavior
under hydrostatic compression. A directional elastic wave velocity analysis shows that hydrostatic
pressure effectively changes the propagation pattern of the elastic waves of both compounds and
switches the directions of propagation. Cohesive energy, phonon dispersion, and Born–Huang con‐
ditions show that these compounds are thermodynamically, mechanically, and dynamically stable,
confirming the practical feasibility of their synthesis. The identified mechanisms for controlling the
auxetic and anisotropic elastic behavior of these compounds offer a vital feature for designing and
developing high‐performance nanoscale electromechanical devices.
