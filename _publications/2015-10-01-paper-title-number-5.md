Based on density functional theory, the structural and elastic properties of InSb<sub>1-x</sub>Bi<sub>x</sub> alloys have been studied using first principle calculations. The generalized gradient approximation in the presence of spin-orbit coupling is utilized to perform the calculations presented in this paper. The calculated lattice constants of InSb<sub>1-x</sub>Bi<sub>x</sub> alloys are in good agreement with the available experimental data. The mechanical stability of these alloys is demonstrated using elastic constants. The ductility and brittleness of these alloys are investigated using both Poisson's ratio and Pugh's ratio. Moreover, the anisotropy of InSb<sub>1-x</sub>Bi<sub>x</sub> alloys is studied using the universal index and the 3D representation of Young's modulus. According to the obtained values of Poisson's ratio, the InSb<sub>0.5</sub>Bi<sub>0.5</sub> and InBi alloys are auxetic materials.
