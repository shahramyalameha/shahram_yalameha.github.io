Strain engineering is a useful approach for tuning and advancing the physical features and characteristics of two-dimensional materials, because of their large susceptibility. Also, these materials are appropriate for the nanophotonic and nanoelectronic applications. So in this work, the equilibrium lattice parameter and phonon spectra of TiS monolayer are first calculated and investigated and the dynamic stability of this monolayer is proved at different uniaxial strains. Then the strain dependence of electronic and thermoelectric properties of TiS monolayer is studied by using generalized gradient approximation plus spin-orbit interaction. Furthermore, the effect of different uniaxial strains on the TiS monolayer optical constants is investigated. The noticeable transparency and reflectivity of this monolayer are observed at low energies.
