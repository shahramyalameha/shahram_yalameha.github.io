We predict the highly stable new full-Heusler order compound Cs(Na, K)<sub>2</sub>Bi, that can take a diverse set of topological states by strain-engineering. Based on first-principles studies, our findings reveal that the hydrostatic lattice compression, uniaxial compression, and uniaxial tension can transition Cs(Na, K)<sub>2</sub>Bi to a trivial semiconductor, a normal insulator, a topological insulator, a Weyl semimetal, a Dirac semimetal, and a Nodal Line semimetal. These topological states, induced by various kinds of strain, exhibit a range of interesting optical and electronic transport properties. These results introduce Cs(Na, K)<sub>2</sub>Bi compounds as promising candidates to make novel topological devices whose properties can be controlled using strain-engineering
