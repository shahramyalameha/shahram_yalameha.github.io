I'm a graduate student at [University of Isfahan](https://ui.ac.ir/EN) studying computational condensed matter physics. I'm currently interested in using and developing computational tools to study quantum non-trivial materials.

Research interests
======

-Quantum nontrivial materials(Topological insulators, Weyl semimetals, Nodal line semimetals, etc.)

-Mechanical properites (Elastic constants, anomalous and anisotropy mechanical properties, elastic wave velocities)

-2D materials
